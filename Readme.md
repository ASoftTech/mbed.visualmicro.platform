## Setup

Make sure within Visual Studio Setup
(Control Panel -> Program and Features -> Microsoft Visual Studio 2015, Right click Change)

  * The option for **Common Tools for Visual C++ 2015** should be enabled for C++ development
  * The option for **Visual C++ Mobile Development -> Visual C++ Android Development**
    to enable the Microsoft MI Debugger

This should lead to an option of vMicro -> Debugger -> Use Visual Studio Debugger
showing up in the menu

For Visual Micro

  * Install / Setup the mbed-cli tool and depends
  * Place the "Micro Platforms" directory into "Documents\Visual Micro" or whichever directory you've selected
    within visual studio under Tools -> Options -> Visual Micro

## Debugging
