## Overview

This is a set of board / platform scripts for use with Visual Micro to enable building / debugging with Mbed
You'll probably need the paid for version of Visual Micro to get this to work since it relies on custom configs

Currently there's a python script within the Tools Directory for generating a board.txt file based on the output of the mbed cli program
